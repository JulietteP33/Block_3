This project represents one of the Block 3 certification projects. It is the Converstion rate challenge project - Supervised Machine Learning.

**For this project, let's take a look at the user data for the www.datascienceweekly.org website. The aim is to help the data scientists who created the newsletter to analyze their users' behavior and define the parameters that could improve the conversion rate into newsletter subscriptions.**

You will find all the project instructions and the date in the "Conversion_rate_instructions" file.
This project has been designed as a kaggle competition. You'll find the predictions to submit to the leaderboard in the "predictions" folder.
